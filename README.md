# Pong
Pong on C++ and SFML. It's not a finished project by any means. It is a personal "for fun and learning" project to better understand C++.

## Known Issues
1) AI is too overpowered.
2) Ball trajectory is too perfect. Maybe add little randomness when it bounces?
3) No game over.

They are more a "gameplay" issues than a code challenges so I decided to left them in the project and move forward.
